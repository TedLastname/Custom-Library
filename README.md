# Custom-Library
The library that I'm making to help me do some simple things easily.
Currently it does some basic math function (add, subtract, power, sqrt, root, factorial, and the choose function), lets you use print() instead of System.out.println(), and lets you write to a file.
Planned updates: Editing for files, and reading files.
